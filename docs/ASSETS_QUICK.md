# Assets (Quick Reference)

## Folder map

- `Breakout3D/Breakout3D/assets/audio/`
  - `sfx/`: sound effects (including some looping SFX)
  - `music/`: looping music tracks
  - `stingers_music/`: short musical stingers
- `Breakout3D/Breakout3D/assets/fonts/`: UI fonts (Orbitron variants)

## Audio naming conventions

- Use `_01/_02/_03` suffixes for variations.
  - The game strips this suffix and groups files automatically.
- Music and stingers use the filename (without extension) as the ID.
